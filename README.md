# 🔧 AI-Powered Industrial Fault Prediction System

## 🎯 From a Simple Idea to a Real-World Machine Learning Project!

I'm thrilled to share that I’ve recently completed a major **AI-powered industrial fault prediction system** as part of a team project!  
Together, we transformed raw sensor data into an intelligent model capable of accurately predicting different types of machine failures. 👨‍💻⚙️

## 🚀 Project Highlights

### 📊 Data Analysis & Preprocessing
- Explored and visualized large-scale industrial sensor data
- Cleaned the dataset: handled missing values, outliers, and anomalies
- Engineered and encoded features using:
  - `OneHotEncoder`
  - `OrdinalEncoder`
  - `Label Encoding`
  - Feature scaling techniques like StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler

---

### 🧠 Model Building & Evaluation
- Built and compared multiple classification models:
  - ✅ Logistic Regression
  - ✅ XGBoost
  - ✅ Naive Baye
  - ✅ SVM
  - ✅ Decision Tree
  - ✅ Random Forest
  - ✅ KNN
  - ...and more!

- Evaluated models using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision & Recall
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Cross-Validation
  - ROC Curve & AUC

- Tuned hyperparameters to boost performance
- Used visualizations to communicate insights clearly

---

### 🌐 Deployment
- Deployed the final model using **Flask**
- Created a user-friendly API endpoint for real-time predictions
- Ready for real-world industrial integration
